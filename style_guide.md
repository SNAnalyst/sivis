The style guide is build on the tidyverse style guide: https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html with the following adaptions:

- The magrittr operator %<>% will be used
- We value both expressive as well as short file names. If in conflict the first is preferred over the second.
- if possible seperate fachlich from technisch. First technisch then fachlich
  -- use pipes to encapsule technical parts
