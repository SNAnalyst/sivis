This is a scraping suggestion for the following website: 
https://phillips66.jobs/jobs/#2
The required content was found in the source code. Therefore, rvest was chosen over RSelenium due to performance reasons.

```{r}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
library(rvest)
library(DT)
url <- "https://phillips66.jobs/jobs/#2"
xpath <- data.frame("
	/html/body/div/div/div/ul/li/h4/a/span
")
data <- read_html(x = url) %>% html_nodes(xpath = as.character(xpath)) %>% html_text()
dt <- datatable(
	data = data.frame(data),
	options = list(pageLength = 10)
)
dt
```
